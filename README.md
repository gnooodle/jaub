Just Another Useful (Discord) Bot

The basic foundations for a general purpose Discord Bot, easily expandable.
To get it up and running, a few changes need to be made.

### Install

Make sure Python is installed properly, and run the `install.bat`

Create a `.env` to ideally store the `BOT_TOKEN` (in the example, it is simply called `token` within the `.env`)

Find the desired `CHANNEL_ID` from Discord for startup message(s) to be sent to (this does not apply to general use, it can be used in any server/channel it has permissions in.)

To start simply run the `start.bat` which will automatically use the venv created.

It should also be noted that this is tested on and made for use on Windows, so nothing else is guaranteed.
